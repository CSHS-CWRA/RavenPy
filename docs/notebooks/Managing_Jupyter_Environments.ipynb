This will allow you to keep a copy of your data on your personal computer. However, note that data stored on this server is not removed or purged. Users are encouraged to use storage on an as-needed basis and to remove data that is not required to free-up resources for other users. PAVICS developers will contact users that use unreasonable amounts of storage space in order to find an alternative solution. The same reasoning also applies to computing power. Users can run multiple kernels/notebooks in parallel, but users are encouraged to use resources on an as-needed basis, with power users potentially being contacted to find alternative solutions.\n",
