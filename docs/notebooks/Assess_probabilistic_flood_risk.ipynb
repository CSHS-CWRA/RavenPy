    "In this notebook, we combine the forecasting abilities and the time series analysis capabilities in a single seamless process to estimate the flood risk of a probabilistic forecast. As an example, we first perform a frequency analysis on an observed time series, then estimate the streamflow associated to a 2-year return period. We then perform a climatological ESP forecast (to ensure repeatability, but a realtime forecast would work too!) and estimate the probability of flooding (exceeding the threshold) given the ensemble of members in the probabilistic forecast."
