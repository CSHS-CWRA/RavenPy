    "This notebook shows how to perform a climatological Extended Streamflow Prediction (ESP) forecast, using historical weather as a proxy for future weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea is to initialize the state of the hydrological model to represent current conditions, but instead of using weather forecasts to predict future flows, we run the model with observed, historical weather series from past years. So for example if we have 30 years of weather observations, we get 30 different forecasts. The accuracy of this forecast ensemble can then be evaluated by different probabilistic metrics."

Finally, we can provide the forecast duration (in number of days) as well as the historical meteorological years we want to use to generate the ESP forecast. This allows selecting years that we want to include in the forecast. For example, perhaps we only want to generate a forecast using wet or dry years."
