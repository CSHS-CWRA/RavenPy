    "## Using Ravenpy to emulate an existing hydrological model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate the versatility of the Raven modelling framework to emulate one of eight hydrological models that are currently supported. We will walk through the different configuration parameters required to build the model and simulate streamflow on a catchments. We will also show how to import files from a pre-configured Raven configuration that users can import into Ravenpy instead of using one of the default emulators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A note on datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous ways to run a Raven model and to pass its required input data. For this introduction to RavenPy, we will use our ERA5 data we generated in the previous notebook and we will configure the Raven model instance on the fly! In the next tutorials, we will see how users can import and use their own datasets to make the entire process flexible and tailored to the user needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using templated model emulators\n",
    "The first thing we need to run the raven model is... a Raven model! Raven is not a model per se, but a modelling framework that can be used to build hydrological models from their underlying components. For now, PAVICS-Hydro allows building a set of pre-determined models. The Python wrapper offers at present eight model emulators: GR4J-CN, HMETS, MOHYSE, HBV-EC, Canadian Shield, HYPR, Sacramento and Blended. For each of these, templated configuration files are available to facilitate launching the model with options passed by Python at run-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next cell, we are going to import the possible models, and later, we will configure and run the GR4J-CN model. Please see the documentation for more details on the mandatory vs optional parameters, and what they represent. A small glimpse is provided here."
