    "## Using Ravenpy to emulate an existing hydrological model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate the versatility of the Raven modelling framework to emulate one of eight hydrological models that are currently supported. We will walk through the different configuration parameters required to build the model and simulate streamflow on a catchments. We will also show how to import files from a pre-configured Raven configuration that users can inport into Ravenpy instead of using one of the default emulators.\n",

    "## A note on datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous ways to run a Raven model and to pass its required input data. For this introduction to RavenPy, we will use our ERA5 data we generated in the previous notebook and we will configure the Raven model instance on the fly! In the next tutorials, we will see how users can import and use their own datasets to make the entire process flexible and tailored to the user needs.\n",

    "## Using templated model emulators\n",
    "The first thing we need to run the raven model is... a Raven model! Raven is not a model per se, but a modelling framework that can be used to build hydrological models from their underlying components. For now, PAVICS-Hydro allows building a set of pre-determined models. The Python wrapper offers at present eight model emulators: GR4J-CN, HMETS, MOHYSE, HBV-EC, Canadian Shield, HYPR, Sacramento and Blended. For each of these, templated configuration files are available to facilitate launching the model with options passed by Python at run-time.\n",

    "In the next cell, we are going to import the possible models, and later, we will configure and run the GR4J-CN model. Please see the documentation for more details on the mandatory vs optional parameters, and what they represent. A small glimpse is provided here."

    "Raven requires a description of the watershed streamflow is simulated in. Different models require different parameters, but minimally, area, elevation, latitude and longitude are required. These data need to be provided for a few reasons:\n",
    "* Area is required since the size of the watershed will directly influence the simulated streamflow. Units are in square kilometers (km²).\n",
    "* Elevation (average elevation of the watershed) is required, although in many models the value is not actually used and therefore can be set to an arbitrary number. We strongly recommend using the real elevation as that will ensure that the value is present if you decide to switch to another model that requires elevation. Elevation is expressed in meters above mean sea level.\n",
    "* Latitude and longitude refer to the catchment centroid, and are used, among others, for evapotranspiration  computations. They are expressed in decimal degrees (°), with longitudes within [-180, 180].\n",
    "\n",
    "These values should be either precomputed externally, or they can be computed using the PAVICS-Hydro geophysical extraction toolbox that we used in the second tutorial notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supplementary information on model parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Each model requires a set of tuning parameters to represent and compensate for unknown quantities in certain hydrological processes. Some models have more parameters than others, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* GR4JCN = 6 parameters\n",
    "* HMETS = 21 parameters\n",
    "* MOHYSE = 10 parameters\n",
    "* HBVEC = 21 parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters are found through calibration by tuning their values until the simulated streamflow matches the observations as much as possible. PAVICS-Hydro provides an integrated calibration toolbox that will be explored in the the 6th step of this tutorial. For now, we simply provided a set of parameters but it is not yet fully calibrated. This explains the poor quality of the simulated hydrograph."
