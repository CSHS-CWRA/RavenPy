    "Hydrological models typically need geographical information about watersheds being simulated: latitude and longitude, area, mean altitude, land-use, etc. Raven is no exception. This notebook shows how to obtain this information using remote services that are made available for users in PAVICS-Hydro. These services connect to a digital elevation model (DEM) and a land-use data set to extract relevant information.\n",

    "The DEM used in the following is the [EarthEnv-DEM90](https://www.earthenv.org/DEM), while the land-use dataset is the [North American Land Change Monitoring System](http://www.cec.org/north-american-environmental-atlas/land-cover-30m-2015-landsat-and-rapideye/). Other data sources could be used, given their availability through the Web Coverage Service (WCS) protocol.\n",

    "Since these computations happen on a specific Geoserver hosted on PAVICS, we need to establish a connection to that service. While the steps are a bit more complex, the good news is that you only need to change a few items in this notebook to tailor results to your needs. For example, this first code snippet is boilerplate and should not be changed.\n"
