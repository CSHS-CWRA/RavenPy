    "Hydrological models have state variables that describe the snow pack, soil moisture, underground reservoirs, etc. Typically, those cannot be measured empirically, so one way to estimate those values is to run the model for a period before the period we are actually interested in, and save the state variables at the end of this *warm-up* simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to save those state variables and use them to configure another Raven simulation. These *states* are configured by the `:HRUStateVariableTable` and `:BasinStateVariables` commands, but `ravenpy` has a convenience function `set_solution` to update those directly from the `solution.rvc` simulation output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we run the model on two years then save the final states. Next, we use those final states to configure the initial state of a second simulation over the next two years. If everything is done correctly, these two series should be identical to a simulation over the full four years.\n",
