    "In this notebook, we perform a sensitivity analysis on GR4JCN to determine the importance of each parameter using the Sobol' sensitivity analysis method. The example shown herein is done using very few parameter samples, and as such, results will be poor and should not be interpreted as-is. However, it is possible to use this code locally using RavenPy to run a much larger sampling on a local computer. \n",

    "We can see that parameters x2 and x3 are more sensitive than the other with total (ST) and 1st order (S1) sensitivities higher than the other parameters. This is true for both objective functions, but could also be different for other metrics, so it is important to keep this in mind when using a sensitivity analysis to determine parameter importance! A common example is a parameter related to snowmelt. This parameter will have no impact if there is no snow during the period used in the model, but would become critical if there were to be snow in following years.\n",

Values are strange because we are using way too few parameter sets to adequately sample the parameter space here, but increasing the value of \"N\" to 1024 or 2048 would allow for a much better estimation for a 6-parameter model."
