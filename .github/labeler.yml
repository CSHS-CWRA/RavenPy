# label rules used by .github/workflows/label.yml

# label 'ci' all automation-related steps and files
#   Since this repository is in itself an automation process to deploy a server instance,
#   we refer here to CI as the 'meta' configuration files for managing the code and integrations with the repository,
#   not configurations related to the deployment process itself.

# Uncomment the following lines to enable the labeler (requires labels with the same name to exist in the repository)

# label 'ci' all automation-related steps and files
