    Generate grid weights in various formats.

    INPUT_FILE: File containing model discretization. Can be either:

    (A) NetCDF file containing at least 1D or 2D latitudes and 1D or 2D longitudes where this
    grid needs to be representative of model outputs that are then required to be routed. The names of the dimensions
    and the variables holding the lat/lon information should be specified with options --dim-names (-d) and --var-names (-v).

    (B) Shapefile (either a .shp or a .zip) that contains shapes of subbasins and one attribute in this
    shapefile that is defining its index in the NetCDF model output file (numbering needs to be [0 ... N-1]). The name of
    this attribute should be specified via option --netcdf-input-field (-f).

    ROUTING_FILE: Shapefile (either a .shp or a .zip) that contains all information of the routing toolbox for the catchment
    of interest (and maybe some more catchments). This file should contain an attribute with a unique identifier for the HRUs:
    the default is "HRU_ID", but it can be set with --routing-id-field (-c).

    The script will output the results as RVT file with a single :GridWeights command block containing the weights (that the user
    is then free to embed or reference, in her own config context).
